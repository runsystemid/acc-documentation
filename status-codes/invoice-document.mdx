Invoice status codes indicate the current state of both purchase and sales invoice documents in the system workflow. These codes help you track where invoices are in their lifecycle.

## Overview

Invoices (both purchase and sales) go through different states from creation to completion. Understanding these status codes helps you:

- Track invoice progress through the system
- Know when invoices can be modified
- Understand the current workflow stage
- Make informed decisions about next steps

## Status Codes Reference

| Code | Status | Description | Usage |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `D`  | **Draft** | Document is in draft state and can be modified | Initial creation, editing phase |
| `F`  | **Final** | Document has been finalized and cannot be modified | Ready for processing |
| `C`  | **Canceled** | Document has been canceled and is no longer active | When errors occur or process is abandoned |

## Detailed Explanations

### Draft Status (`D`)

**When it occurs:** During initial invoice creation and editing phase

**What it means:** The invoice is in a work-in-progress state where:
- All fields can be modified
- Line items can be added/removed
- Pricing and quantities can be adjusted
- The invoice is not yet processed by the system

**Next steps:** Review line items, pricing, and customer/vendor information before finalizing

**Example scenario:** Creating a new sales invoice for customer order

### Final Status (`F`)

**When it occurs:** After invoice has been reviewed and approved

**What it means:** The invoice is locked and ready for processing:
- No further modifications allowed
- System can process the invoice
- Ready for payment processing or fulfillment

**Next steps:** System will automatically process the invoice according to configured rules

**Example scenario:** Invoice approved by manager and ready for customer billing

### Canceled Status (`C`)

**When it occurs:** When invoice needs to be voided or abandoned

**What it means:** The invoice is no longer active:
- Cannot be modified or processed
- Remains in system for audit purposes
- Requires cancel reason documentation

**Next steps:** Create new invoice if needed, or investigate why cancellation occurred

**Example scenario:** Customer requested cancellation due to order changes
