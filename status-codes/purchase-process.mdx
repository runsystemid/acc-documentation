Process status codes for purchase invoices show the current payment status of these documents. These codes help you track where documents are in the payment workflow.

## Overview

Purchase invoices go through different payment stages from creation to completion. Understanding these process status codes helps you:

- Track payment progress through the system
- Know when payments are due or overdue
- Understand the current payment stage
- Monitor outstanding amounts

## Process Status Codes Reference

| Code | Status | Description | Meaning |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `UP` | **Unpaid** | Document has not been paid at all | Payment is required, no payments received |
| `PP` | **Partially Paid** | Document has been partially paid | Some payment received, balance still outstanding |
| `FP` | **Fully Paid** | Document has been completely paid | Full payment received, no outstanding balance |

## Detailed Explanations

### Unpaid Status (`UP`)

**When it occurs:** When document is first created or no payments have been made

**What it means:** The document requires payment:
- No payments have been received yet
- Full amount is outstanding
- Payment is due according to terms

**What happens next:** Customer/vendor should make payment according to payment terms

**Example scenario:** New purchase invoice created for vendor services, payment due in 30 days

### Partially Paid Status (`PP`)

**When it occurs:** After some payment has been received but not the full amount

**What it means:** Partial payment has been made:
- Some payment received
- Balance amount still outstanding
- Document remains active until fully paid

**What happens next:** Continue collecting remaining balance

**Example scenario:** Customer made partial payment of \$500 on \$1000 invoice, $500 still outstanding

### Fully Paid Status (`FP`)

**When it occurs:** After the complete payment amount has been received

**What it means:** Payment is complete:
- Full amount has been paid
- No outstanding balance
- Document is fully settled

**What happens next:** Document is marked as complete, no further payment action needed

**Example scenario:** Customer paid remaining $500, invoice now fully paid and closed

## Common Scenarios

### Purchase Invoice Payment
1. **Unpaid (UP)**: Vendor invoice received, payment due
2. **Partially Paid (PP)**: Partial payment made to vendor
3. **Fully Paid (FP)**: Complete payment made, invoice settled

## Payment Terms Impact

### Net 30 Terms
- Document starts as **Unpaid (UP)**
- Remains **Unpaid (UP)** until payment received
- Moves to **Partially Paid (PP)** if partial payment
- Becomes **Fully Paid (FP)** when complete

### Immediate Payment
- Document may move directly from **Unpaid (UP)** to **Fully Paid (FP)**
- **Partially Paid (PP)** status may be skipped
