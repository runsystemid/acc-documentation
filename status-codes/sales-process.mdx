## Detailed Explanations

### Open Status (`OP`)

**When it occurs:** When invoice is first created and issued to customer

**What it means:** The invoice is ready for payment processing:
- Invoice has been sent to customer
- Payment is expected according to terms
- No payments have been received yet
- Invoice is active and awaiting payment

**What happens next:** Customer should review invoice and make payment

**Example scenario:** Sales invoice created and sent to customer for services rendered

### Partially Invoiced Status (`PI`)

**When it occurs:** When only some items or services have been fulfilled

**What it means:** Partial fulfillment has occurred:
- Some items have been delivered/completed
- Remaining items are still pending
- Customer may pay for completed portion
- Invoice remains active until fully fulfilled

**What happens next:** Complete remaining items or services to move to fully invoiced

**Example scenario:** Customer ordered 10 items, only 6 have been delivered so far

### Fully Invoiced Status (`FI`)

**When it occurs:** When all items or services have been completed

**What it means:** Complete fulfillment has occurred:
- All items have been delivered/completed
- All services have been rendered
- Invoice is ready for full payment
- No outstanding fulfillment items

**What happens next:** Customer should make full payment for completed invoice

**Example scenario:** All 10 ordered items have been delivered, invoice ready for payment

### Partially Paid Status (`PP`)

**When it occurs:** After some payment has been received but not the full amount

**What it means:** Partial payment has been made:
- Some payment received from customer
- Balance amount still outstanding
- Invoice remains active until fully paid
- Customer may make additional payments

**What happens next:** Continue collecting remaining balance from customer

**Example scenario:** Customer paid \$300 on \$500 invoice, $200 still outstanding

### Fully Paid Status (`FP`)

**When it occurs:** After the complete payment amount has been received

**What it means:** Payment is complete:
- Full amount has been paid by customer
- No outstanding balance
- Invoice is fully settled
- Customer account is up to date

**What happens next:** Invoice is marked as complete, no further action needed

**Example scenario:** Customer paid remaining $200, invoice now fully paid and closed
