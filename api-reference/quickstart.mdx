### API Overview

The Accounting\+ API is organized around REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs. All API responses return JSON and use standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

**Base URL:** `https://api.example.com`

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Signature Key. Include your token in the `ACC-Signature` header:

```bash
curl -H "ACC-Signature: YOUR_SIGNATURE" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/vouchers
```

<Note>
  Contact your system administrator or account manager to obtain your secret key.
</Note>

### Example

Here's a simple example to retrieve your vouchers:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.example.com/v1/vouchers?limit=10&page=1" \
  -H "ACC-Signature: YOUR_SIGNATURE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```


```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/api/v1/vouchers?limit=10&page=1', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'ACC-Signature': 'YOUR_SIGNATURE'
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```


```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'ACC-Signature': 'YOUR_SIGNATURE'
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://app.accountingplus.id/api/v1/vouchers',
    headers=headers,
    params={'limit': 10, 'page': 1}
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json

  "status": "00",
