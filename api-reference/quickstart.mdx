# API Overview

The Accounting\+ API is organized around REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs. All API responses return JSON and use standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

**Base URL:** `https://staging-openapi.accountingplus.id`

## Authentication

You need these 3 variables to be able to fully integrated with Accounting+.

| Name | Data Type | Sample |
|----|----|----|
| client_id | string | thepartner |
| client_secret | string | `rrqfQPvstlTSXc9zezzCTXTt3LgEGrEa` |
| signature_secret | string | `yH0G6cfb0714XA6Mr36xEGxeEtbD2gph` |

<Note>
  Contact your system administrator or account manager to obtain these keys.
</Note>

Beside that, the user email and tenant_id are required for some API.

The following parameters must be included in the request header for every API call (excluding the Get Token, Register, and Login endpoints):

| Key | Value |
|----|----|
| Authorization | Bearer _YOUR_TOKEN_ |
| A-Signature | _YOUR_SIGNATURE_ |
| A-Data | _YOUR_DATA_ |

### Token (Authorization)

Before making an API request to Accounting+ API, you must obtain a token by calling the [API Get Token](/api-reference/endpoint/get-token).

### A-Signature

As additional security guard in every API request, Accounting+ API uses a signature to ensure that the data in each request and response cannot be hijacked and copied by unauthorized users.
This signature is generated using the SHA256-HMAC algorithm and use `signature_secret` as key.

Example: Creating a signature containing path, token, and email

```json
path=/v1/sample&token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiJ0ZXN0In0.6c_QFWhU8Yvb_4kZ1kTiovsSfNKAC0oQ4tQs45rjy9U&email=john@gmail.com
```

Sample encrypted with SHA256-HMAC using `yH0G6cfb0714XA6Mr36xEGxeEtbD2gph` as the key:

```json
e2d3a074b3478eb658cf2d0b4eae8d2db7e75fca0caabb83d80aa0df01617fae
```

Base64 encoded format:

```json
eUgwRzZjZmIwNzE0WEE2TXIzNnhFR3hlRXRiRDJncGg=
```

In this documentation, the encrypted result will be referred to as *YOUR_SIGNATURE*.

### A-Data

A-Data contains email and tenant_id variables to identify the user calling the endpoint. Here's an example of how to form it:

```json
email=john@gmail.com&tenant_id=055
```

Base64 encoded format:

```json
ZW1haWw9am9obkBnbWFpbC5jb20mdGVuYW50X2lkPTA5OQ==
```

In this documentation, the encoded result will be referred to as *YOUR_DATA*.

## Example

Here's a simple example to retrieve your monthly cashflow:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET \
  "https://staging-openapi.accountingplus.id/v1/dashboard/monthly-cashflow?month=1&year=2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "A-Signature: YOUR_SIGNATURE" \
  -H "A-Data": YOUR_DATA"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://staging-openapi.accountingplus.id/v1/dashboard/monthly-cashflow?month=1&year=2025', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    'Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN'
    'A-Signature': YOUR_SIGNATURE'
    'A-Data: YOUR_DATA'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'YOUR_TOKEN'
    'A-Signature': 'YOUR_SIGNATURE'
    'A-Data': 'YOUR_DATA'
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://staging-openapi.accountingplus.id/v1/dashboard/monthly-cashflow',
    headers=headers,
    params={'month': 1, 'year': 2025}
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

</CodeGroup>
